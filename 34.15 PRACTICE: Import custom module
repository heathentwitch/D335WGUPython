Instructions:

Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
Task:

Create a solution that accepts an integer input representing the age of a pig. Import the existing module pigAge and use its pre-built pigAge_converter() function to calculate the human equivalent age of a pig. A year in a pig's life is equivalent to five years in a human's life. Output the human-equivalent age of the pig.

The solution output should be in the format

input_pig_age is converted_pig_age in human years

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

8

then the expected output is

8 is 40 in human years






#import pigAge module and call pigAge_converter()
#one pig year is equivalent to five human years
#solution accepts integer input representing a pig's age
#solution outputs the human equivalent age for a pig (i.e. "8 is 40 in human years")

from pigAge import pigAge_converter

user_input = int(input())
print(f'{user_input} is {pigAge_converter(user_input)} in human years')
