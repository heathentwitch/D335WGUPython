Write a program that takes in a string that holds the values "day" or "night" and an integer that holds a person's age, and outputs a movie ticket price. Movie prices are free for everyone under the age of 4. Daytime prices are $8 for everyone age 4 or higher. Nighttime prices are $12 for ages 4 - 16, $15 for ages 17 - 54 and $13 for ages 55 and above.

Ex: If the input is:

night
50

the output is:

$15

Ex: If the input is:

day
15

the output is:

$8

Ex: If the input is:

night
3

the output is:

free







time = input()
age = int(input())

kid = 12
adult = 15 
senior = 13

if time == "night":
    if 0 <= age <= 3:
        print('free')
    if 4 <= age <= 16:
        print(f'${kid}')
    if 17 <= age <= 54:
        print(f'${adult}')
    if age >= 55:
        print(f'${senior}')
else:
    if 0<= age <=3:
        print('free')
        exit()
    print('$8')
