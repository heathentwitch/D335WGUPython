People find it easier to read time in hours, minutes, and seconds rather than just seconds.

Write a program that reads in seconds as input, and outputs the time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Ex: If the input is:

4000

the output is:

Hours: 1
Minutes: 6
Seconds: 40



''' Type your code here '''
seconds = int(input())

hours_total = (seconds // 60) // 60
minutes = (seconds % 3600) // 60 
seconds_total = seconds % 60





print(f'Hours: {hours_total}')
print(f'Minutes: {minutes}')
print(f'Seconds: {seconds_total}')
