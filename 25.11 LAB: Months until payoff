Write a program that reads a loan amount, payment amount, and interest rate as inputs and outputs the number of payments required until the loan is paid. Interest is added to current balance before a payment is applied. Ex: If current balance is $100.00 and the interest rate is 0.02, the new balance is $102.00 before a payment is applied. All values are floats.

Ex: If the input is:

1000.0
50.0
0.03

the output is:

31 payments

Ex: If the input is:

50.0
100.0
0.02

the output is:

1 payment





# Type your code here.
loan_amount = float(input())
payment_amount = float(input())
interest = float(input())


   
count = 0

while loan_amount > 0:
   
    interest_rate = interest * loan_amount
    new_loan_amount = interest_rate + loan_amount
    payment = new_loan_amount - payment_amount
    count += 1 
    loan_amount = payment
        
    if loan_amount <= 0:
        loan_amount = 0
        break

if count > 1:
    print(f'{count} payments')
elif count == 1: 
    print(f'{count} payment')
