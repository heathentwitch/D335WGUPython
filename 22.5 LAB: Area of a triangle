Using Heron's formula, you can calculate the area of a triangle if you know the lengths of all three sides. Given the length of each side of a triangle as input, calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula as follows:

    s = half of the triangle's perimeter
    area = the square root of s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c), where a, b, and c are each sides of the triangle.

Hint: Use the sqrt() function from the math module to calculate the square root.

Output the floating-point value of the area with three digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'The area of the triangle is: {your_value:.3f}')

Ex: If the input for a, b, and c is:

3.0
4.0
5.0

the output is:

The area of the triangle is: 6.000


import math

''' Type your code here. '''
a = float(input())
b = float(input())
c = float(input())


total = a + b + c
s = total / 2
area = math.sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))


#print(total)


print(f'The area of the triangle is: {area:.3f}')
