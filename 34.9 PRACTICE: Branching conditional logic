Instructions:

Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
Task:

Create a solution that accepts an integer input representing water temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Output a description of the water state based on the following scale:

    If the temperature is below 33° F, the water is “Frozen”.
    If the water is between 33° F and 80° F (including 33), the water is “Cold”.
    If the water is between 80° F and 115° F (including 80), the water is "Warm".
    If the water is between 115° F and 211° (including 115) F, the water is “Hot".
    If the water is greater than or equal to 212° F, the water is “Boiling”.

Additionally, output a safety comment only during the following circumstances:

    If the water is exactly 212° F, the safety comment is "Caution: Hot!"
    If the water temperature is less than 33° F, the safety comment is "Watch out for ice!"

The solution output should be in the format

water_state
optional_safety_comment

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

118

then the expected output is

Hot

Alternatively, if the input is

32

then the expected output is

Frozen
Watch out for ice!







#solution accepts integer input representing a water temperature
#temperature >= 212, water state is "Boiling"
#temperature between 115-211, exclusive of the stop, water state is "Hot"
#temperature between 80-115, water state is "Warm"
#temperature between 33-80, water state is "Cold"
#temperature < 33, water state is "Frozen"
#temperature = 212, safety comment "Caution: Hot!"
#temperature < 33, safety comment "Watch out for ice!"
#solution outputs the water state and potential safety comment based on temperature
water_temp = int(input())
if water_temp >= 212:
    print("Boiling")
    if water_temp == 212:
        print("Caution: Hot!")
elif water_temp >= 115 and water_temp <= 211:
    print("Hot")
elif water_temp >= 80 and water_temp <= 115:
    print("Warm")
elif water_temp >= 33 and water_temp <= 80: 
    print("Cold")
elif water_temp < 33:
    print("Frozen")
    print("Watch out for ice!")
