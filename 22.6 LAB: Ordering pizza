A local pizza shop is selling a large pizza for $9.99. Given the number of pizzas to order as input, output the subtotal for the pizzas, and then output the total after applying a sales tax of 6%.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'Subtotal: ${yourValue:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

3

the output is:

Subtotal: $29.97
Total due: $31.77




''' Type your code here. '''
user_input = int(input())

pizza = 9.99
tax = 0.06
subtotal = user_input * pizza
tax = subtotal * tax
total = subtotal + tax
print(f'Subtotal: ${subtotal:.2f}')
print(f'Total due: ${total:.2f}')
