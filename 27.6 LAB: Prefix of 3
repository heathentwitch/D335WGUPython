The prefix of 3 is the first 3 characters of a string. Given a string input, output the first three characters of that string. Assume the string will always have at least three characters.

Ex: If the input is:

chicken

the output is:

Prefix: chi






''' Type your code here. '''
user_input = input()
drei = int(len(user_input))

print(f'Prefix: {user_input[0:3]}')
