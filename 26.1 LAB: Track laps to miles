One lap around a standard high-school running track is exactly 0.25 miles. Define a function named laps_to_miles that takes a number of laps as a parameter, and returns the number of miles. Then, write a main program that takes a number of laps as an input, calls function laps_to_miles() to calculate the number of miles, and outputs the number of miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

7.6

the output is:

1.90

Ex: If the input is:

2.2

the output is:

0.55

The program must define and call the following function:
def laps_to_miles(user_laps)




# Define your function here 
def laps_to_miles(user_laps):
    return user_laps * 0.25 


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Type your code here. Your code must call the function. 
    user_laps = float(input())
    miles = laps_to_miles(user_laps)
    print(f'{miles:.2f}')
