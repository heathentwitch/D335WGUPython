The midfix of 3 is the middle 3 characters of a string. Given a string input, output the middle three characters of that string. Assume the word length is always odd and at least three characters.

Ex: If the input is:

xxxtoyxxx

the output is:

Midfix: toy




user_string = input()

index = int((len(user_string)/2)-1)
print(f'Midfix: {user_string[index:index+3]}')
