Program Specifications Write a program to calculate the cost to paint a wall. Amount of required paint is based on the wall area. Total cost includes paint and sales tax.

Note: This program is designed for incremental development. Complete each step and submit for grading before starting the next step. Only a portion of tests pass after each step but confirm progress.

Step 1 (2 pts). Read from input wall height, wall width, and cost of one paint can (floats). Calculate and output the wall's area to one decimal place using print(f"Wall area: {wall_area:.1f} sq ft");. Submit for grading to confirm 1 test passes.

Ex: If the input is:

12.0
15.0
29.95

the output is:

Wall area: 180.0 sq ft

Step 2 (2 pts). Calculate and output the amount of paint needed to three decimal places. One gallon of paint covers 350 square feet. Submit for grading to confirm 2 tests pass.

Ex: If the input is:

12.0
15.0
29.95

the output is:

Wall area: 180.0 sq ft
Paint needed: 0.514 gallons

Step 3 (2 pts). Calculate and output the number of 1 gallon cans needed to paint the wall. Extra paint may be left over. Hint: Use ceil() from the math module to round up to the nearest gallon (int). Submit for grading to confirm 4 tests pass.

Ex: If the input is:

12.0
15.0
29.95

the output is:

Wall area: 180.0 sq ft
Paint needed: 0.5142 gallons
Cans needed: 1 can(s)

Step 4 (4 pts). Calculate and output the paint cost, sales tax of 7%, and total cost. Dollar values are output with two decimal places. Submit for grading to confirm all tests pass.

Ex: If the input is:

8.0
8.0
49.20

the output is:

Wall area: 64.0 sq ft
Paint needed: 0.183 gallons
Cans needed: 1 can(s)
Paint cost: $49.20
Sales tax: $3.44
Total cost: $52.64

print(f'Paint needed: {paint_can:.3f} gallons')
cans = ceil(paint_can)
print(f'Cans needed: {cans} can(s)')
tax = 0.07
subtotal = cans * paintcan_cost
sales_tax = subtotal * tax
total = sales_tax + subtotal
print(f'Paint cost: ${subtotal:.2f}')
print(f'Sales tax: ${sales_tax:.2f}')
print(f'Total cost: ${total:.2f}')
