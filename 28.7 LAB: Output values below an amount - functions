Write a program that first gets integers from input. The input begins with a threshold value. Then, subsequent input values are added to a list until -1 is entered. Finally, output all integers less than or equal to the threshold value.

Ex: If the input is:

100
50
60
140
200
75
-1

the output is:

50
60
75

The 100 indicates that the program should output all integers less than or equal to 100. Next, five integers are added to the list: 50, 60, 140, 200, and 75. Finally, -1 indicates the end of the list.

Such functionality is common on sites like Amazon, where a user can filter results.

Write your code to define and use two functions:
get_user_values(nums)
output_ints_less_than_or_equal_to_threshold(nums, threshold)









# Define your get_user_values function here
def get_user_values(nums):
    while True:
        value = int(input())
        if value == -1:
            break
        nums.append(value)

# Define your output_ints_less_than_or_equal_to_threshold function here
def output_ints_less_than_or_equal_to_threshold(nums, threshold):
    for num in nums:
        if num <= threshold:
            print(num)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    threshold = int(input())
    nums = []
    
    get_user_values(nums)
    output_ints_less_than_or_equal_to_threshold(nums, threshold)
