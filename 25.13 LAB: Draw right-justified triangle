Write a program to draw a right-justified triangle given the height as input. The first row has one asterisk (*) and increases by one for each row. Each asterisk is followed by a blank space and each row ends with a newline.

Ex: If the input is:

3

the output is:

    * 
  * *
* * * 



# Type your code here.
number = int(input())
char = '* ' # space after * adds space when character is printed

for i in range(1, number + 1):
        print('  ' * (number - i) + (char) * i) #the first '' is 2 spaces to push triangle to the right.
