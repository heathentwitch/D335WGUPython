Instructions:

Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
Task:

Create a solution that accepts an integer input. Import the built-in module math and use its factorial() method to calculate the factorial of the integer input. Output the value of the factorial, as well as a Boolean value identifying whether the factorial output is greater than 100.

The solution output should be in the format

factorial_value
Boolean_value

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

10

then the expected output is

3628800
True

Alternatively, if the input is

3

then the expected output is

6
False
