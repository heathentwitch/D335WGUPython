Write a program that repeatedly reads in integers until a negative integer is read. The program also keeps track of the largest integer that has been read so far and outputs the largest integer at the end.

Ex: If the input is:

2
77
17
4
-1

the output is:

77

Assume a user will enter at least one non-negative integer.






''' Type your code here. '''
num = int(input())
number = []
while num >= 0:
    number.append(num)
    num = int(input())

    
print(max(number))
