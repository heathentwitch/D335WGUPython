Write a program that takes in three lowercase characters and outputs the characters in alphabetical order.

Hint: Ordering three characters takes six permutations.

Ex: If the input is:

c
a
b

the output is:

a b c






# Type your code here.
a = input()
b = input()
c = input()
lists = [a, b, c]
lists = sorted(lists)
print(*lists)
