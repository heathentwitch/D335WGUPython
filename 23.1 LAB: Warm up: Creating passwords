Step 1 (1 pt): Have the user to enter two words (favorite_color and pet_name) and a number, storing each into separate variables. Then, output the three values on a single line separated by a space.

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy
6

the output is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6

Note: User input is not part of the program output.

Step 2 (2 pts): Output two passwords using a combination of the user input. Format the passwords as shown below.

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy
6

the output is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6

First password: yellow_Daisy
Second password: 6yellow6


Step 3 (2 pts): Output the length of each password (the number of characters in the strings).

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy
6

the output is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6

First password: yellow_Daisy
Second password: 6yellow6

Number of characters in yellow_Daisy: 12
Number of characters in 6yellow6: 8
