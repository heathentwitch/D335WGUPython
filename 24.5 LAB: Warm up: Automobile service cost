(1) Prompt the user for an automobile service. Output the user's input. (1 pt)

Ex:

Enter desired auto service:
Oil change
You entered: Oil change


(2) Output the price of the requested service. (4 pts)

Ex:

Enter desired auto service:
Oil change
You entered: Oil change
Cost of oil change: $35


The program should support the following services (all integers):

    Oil change -- $35
    Tire rotation -- $19
    Car wash -- $7

If the user enters a service that is not listed above, then output the following error message:

Error: Requested service is not recognized







services = input("Enter desired auto service:\n")


print(f'You entered: {services}')
services = services.lower()
if services in services == "oil change":
    cost = 35
    print(f'Cost of {services}: ${cost}')
elif services in services == "tire rotation":
    cost = 19
    print(f'Cost of {services}: ${cost}')
elif services in services == "car wash":
    cost = 7
    print(f'Cost of {services}: ${cost}')
else:
    print("Error: Requested service is not recognized")
