Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's gas mileage (miles/gallon) and the cost of gas (dollars/gallon) as floating-point input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

20.0
3.1599

where the gas mileage is 20.0 miles/gallon and the cost of gas is $3.1599/gallon, the output is:

3.16 11.85 79.00

Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation.






''' Type your code here. '''
cars_miles_per_gallon = float(input())
fuel_price = float(input())

distance1 = 20  
distance2 = 75
distance3 = 500

distance1_total = (distance1 / cars_miles_per_gallon) * fuel_price
distance2_total = (distance2 / cars_miles_per_gallon) * fuel_price
distance3_total = (distance3 / cars_miles_per_gallon) * fuel_price

print(f'{distance1_total:.2f} {distance2_total:.2f} {distance3_total:.2f}')
