Given a line of text as input, output the number of characters excluding spaces, periods, exclamation points, or commas.

Ex: If the input is:

Listen, Mr. Jones, calm down.

the output is:

21

Note: Account for all characters that aren't spaces, periods, exclamation points, or commas (Ex: "r", "2", "?").






user_text = input().strip()
alpha = 0
for char in user_text:
    if char not in [' ', '.', '!', ',']:
        alpha += 1
print(alpha)
