Write a program that is given two integers representing a speed limit and driving speed in miles per hour (mph) and outputs the traffic ticket amount.

Driving 10 mph under the speed limit (or slower) receives a $50 ticket. Driving 6 - 20 mph over the speed limit receives a $75 ticket. Driving 21 - 40 mph over the speed limit receives a $150 ticket. Driving faster than 40 mph over the speed limit receives a $300 ticket. Otherwise, no ticket is received.

Ex: If the input is:

35
45

the output is:

75

Ex: If the input is:

35
26

the output is:

0



speed_limit = int(input())
driving_speed = int(input())

def speed_diff(speed_limit, driving_speed):
    speed = driving_speed - speed_limit

    if speed <= -10:
        print(50)
    elif 6<= speed <= 20:
        print(75)
    elif 21 <= speed <= 40:
        print(150)
    elif 41 <= speed <= 100:
        print(300)
    else:
        print(0)
    return speed
        
speed_diff(speed_limit, driving_speed)
