Given two numbers that represent the lengths of a right triangle's legs (sides adjacent to the right angle), output the length of the third side (i.e. hypotenuse) with two digits after the decimal point.

Note: To output the length of the hypotenuse with two digits after the decimal point, use:
print(f'Hypotenuse: {side3:.2f}'), where side3 is the variable representing the length of the hypotenuse.

Ex: If the input is:

3.0
4.0

the output is:

Hypotenuse: 5.00





import math
''' Type your code here. '''
a = float(input())
b = float(input())

side33 = (a ** 2) + (b ** 2)
side3 = math.sqrt(side33)
print(f'Hypotenuse: {side3:.2f}')
