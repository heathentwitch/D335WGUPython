Write a program that reads a list of integers into a list as long as the integers are greater than zero, then outputs the smallest and largest integers in the list.

Ex: If the input is:

10
5
3
21
2
-6

the output is:

2 and 21

You can assume that the list of integers will have at least 2 values.








numbers = []
while True:
    num = int(input())
    if num < 0:
        break
    numbers.append(num)
        
smallest = min(numbers)
largest = max(numbers)
print(f'{smallest} and {largest}')
