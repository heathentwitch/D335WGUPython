Write a program that reads a list of integers, one per line, until an * is read, then outputs those integers in reverse. For simplicity in coding output, follow each integer, including the last one, by a comma.

Note: Use a while loop to output the integers. DO NOT use reverse() or reversed().

Ex: If the input is:

2
4
6
8
10
*

the output is:

10,8,6,4,2,




''' Type your code here. '''
num = input()
number = []
end = '*'

while num != end:
    number.append(int(num))
    num = input()


index = len(number) - 1

while index >= 0:
    print(number[index], end=',')
    index -= 1 
        
print()
#the last print statement is there because the program expects after last number to got to new line. did not know that until went to grade.
