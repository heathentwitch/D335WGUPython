Write a program that reads in hours, minutes, and seconds as input, and outputs the time in seconds only.

Ex: If the input is:

1
6
40

where 1 is the number of hours, 6 is the number of minutes, and 40 is the number of seconds, the output is:

Seconds: 4000

''' Type your code here '''
hours = int(input())
minutes = int(input())
seconds = int(input())

hours_total = (hours * 60) * 60
minutes_total = minutes * 60

total = hours_total + minutes_total + seconds
print(f'Seconds: {total}')
