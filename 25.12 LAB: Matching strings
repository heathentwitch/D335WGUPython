Write a program that compares two strings given as input. Output the number of characters that match in each string position. The output should use the correct verb (match vs matches) according to the character count.

Ex: If the input is:

crash
crush

the output is:

4 characters match

Ex: If the input is:

cat
catnip

the output is:

3 characters match

Ex: If the input is:

mall
saw

the output is:

1 character matches

Ex: If the input is:

apple
orange

the output is:

0 characters match



# Type your code here.

word1 = input()
word2 = input()


# need to make sure words match count wise 
min_length = min(len(word1), len(word2))

#initialize the counter
match = 0
for i in range(min_length):
    if word1[i] == word2[i]: #word1[i] == word2[i] compares each letter at each position
        match +=1


if match > 1:
    print(f'{match} characters match')
if match == 1:
    print(f'{match} character matches')
if match == 0:
    print(f'{match} characters match')
