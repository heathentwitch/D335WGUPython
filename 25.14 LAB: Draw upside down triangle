Write a program that outputs a right triangle of asterisks given the height as input. Each line ends with a blank space.

Ex: If the input is:

3

the output is:

* * * 
* * 
* 




# Type your code here.
number = int(input())
char = '*'
for i in range(number, 0, -1): #the range is input number down to 0 -1 is decreasing count at each iteration. 
    print((char + ' ') * i)
