Given the number of people attending a pizza party, output the number of needed pizzas and total cost. For the calculation, assume that people eat 2 slices on average and each pizza has 12 slices and costs $14.95.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'Cost: ${cost:.2f}')

Hint: Use the ceil() function from the math module to round up the number of pizzas so that enough pizzas are ordered.

Ex: If the input is:

4

the output is:

Pizzas: 1
Cost: $14.95



import math

''' Type your code here. '''
user_input = int(input())
price = 14.95
slicesper = 12 // 6
pizza = 12 
pizzas = math.ceil(user_input * slicesper / pizza)

cost = price * pizzas

print(f'Pizzas: {pizzas}') 
print(f'Cost: ${cost:.2f}')
