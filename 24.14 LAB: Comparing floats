Write a program that is given two floats for comparison and a third float that is a difference threshold, called epsilon. Output one of three phrases:

    output "equal" if the floats are within 0.001 (exclusively) of each other

    output "close enough" if the floats are within epsilon (exclusively) of each other

    output "not close" if floats are not within epsilon

Ex: If the input is:

14.1
14.2
0.2

the output is:

close enough

Ex: If the input is:

2.1125
2.1132
0.02

the output is:

equal

Ex: If the input is:

5.1
5.0
0.05

the output is:

not close




num1 = float(input())
num2 = float(input())
epsilon = float(input())

if abs(num1 - num2) < 0.001:
    print('equal')
elif abs(num1 - num2) < epsilon:
    print('close enough')
else:
    print('not close')
