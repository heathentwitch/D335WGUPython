Write a program that takes in an integer in the range 11-100 as input. The output is a countdown starting from the integer, and stopping when both output digits are identical.

Ex: If the input is:

93

the output is:

93
92
91
90
89
88

Ex: If the input is:

11

the output is:

11

Ex: If the input is:

9

or any value not between 11 and 100 (inclusive), the output is:

Input must be 11-100

Use a while loop. Compare the digits; do not write a large if-else for all possible same-digit numbers (11, 22, 33, â€¦, 99), as that approach would be cumbersome for larger ranges.




''' Type your code here. '''
num = int(input())

if num < 11 or num > 100:
    print("Input must be 11-100")
else:
    while True:
        print(num)
        tens = num // 10
        ones = num % 10
        if tens == ones: 
            break
        num -= 1
