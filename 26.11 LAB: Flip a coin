Define a function named coin_flip that returns "Heads" or "Tails" according to a random value 1 or 0. Assume the value 1 represents "Heads" and 0 represents "Tails". Then, write a main program that reads the desired number of coin flips as an input, calls function coin_flip() repeatedly according to the number of coin flips, and outputs the results. Assume the input is a value greater than 0.

Ex: If the random seed value is 5 and the input is:

3

the output is:

Heads
Heads
Tails

Note: For testing purposes, a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed value is used in the program. The program uses a seed value of 5 during development, but when submitted, a different seed value may be used for each test case.

The program must define and call the following function:
def coin_flip()






import random

def coin_flip():
# Define your function here
    if random.randint(0,1) == 1: 
        return "Heads"
    else: 
        return "Tails"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    random.seed(5)  # Unique seed
    number_of_flips = int(input())
    for _ in range(number_of_flips):
        print(coin_flip())
    # Type your code here.
