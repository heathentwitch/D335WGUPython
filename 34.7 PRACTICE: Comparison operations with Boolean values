Instructions:

Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
Task:

Create a solution that accepts an integer input to compare against the following list:

predef_list = [4, -27, 15, 33, -10]

Output a Boolean value indicating whether the input value is greater than the maximum value from predef_list

The solution output should be in the format

Greater Than Max? Boolean_value

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

20

then the expected output is

Greater Than Max? False





predef_list = [4, -27, 15, 33, -10]

#solution accepts an integer input
#solution outputs Boolean value indicating if integer input is greater than the maximum value when compared to predef_list
num_input = int(input())


if num_input > max(predef_list):
    print("Greater Than Max? True")
else:
    print("Greater Than Max? False")
