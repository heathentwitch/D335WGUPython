Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output x to the power of z, x to the power of (y to the power of z), the absolute value of (x minus y), and the square root of (x to the power of z).

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f} {your_value4:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

5.0
1.5
3.2

Then the output is:

172.47 361.66 3.50 13.13






import math
''' Type your code here. '''
x = float(input())
y = float(input())
z = float(input())

value1 = x ** z
value2 = x ** (y ** z)
value3 = abs(x - y)
value4 = math.sqrt(x ** z)

print(f'{value1:.2f} {value2:.2f} {value3:.2f} {value4:.2f}')
