Write a program that reads a list of words. Then, the program outputs those words and their frequencies (case insensitive).

Ex: If the input is:

hey Hi Mark hi mark

the output is:

hey 1
Hi 2
Mark 2
hi 2
mark 2

Hint: Use lower() to set each word to lowercase before comparing.





''' Type your code here. '''

words = input().split()
word_counts = {}

for word in words:
    word_lower = word.lower()
    word_counts[word_lower] = word_counts.get(word_lower, 0) + 1

for word in words:
    print(f'{word} {word_counts[word.lower()]}')
