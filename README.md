# D335WGUPython
These are the codes I wrote for the labs in zybooks for D335. I figured I should upload them to help if some one was struggling like I am. Look at them try to figure what you need to do and then write it your way to help it stick in your mind. 
I didnt know anything about python when this class started but it is finally comint to me little by little.
