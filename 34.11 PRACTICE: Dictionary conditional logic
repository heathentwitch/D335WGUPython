Instructions:

Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
Task:

Create a solution that accepts a string input representing a grocery store item and an integer input identifying the number of items purchased on a recent visit. The following dictionary purchase lists available items as the key with the cost per item as the value.

purchase = {"bananas": 1.85, "steak": 19.99, "cookies": 4.52, "celery": 2.81, "milk": 4.34}

Additionally,

    If fewer than ten items are purchased, the price is the full cost per item.
    If between ten and twenty items (inclusive) are purchased, the purchase gets a 5% discount.
    If twenty-one or more items are purchased, the purchase gets a 10% discount.

Output the chosen item and total cost of the purchase to two decimal places.

The solution output should be in the format

item_purchased $total_purchase_cost

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

bananas
12

then the expected output is

bananas $21.09

Alternatively, if the input is

cookies
144

then the expected output is

cookies $585.79







purchase = {"bananas": 1.85, "steak": 19.99, "cookies": 4.52, "celery": 2.81, "milk": 4.34}

#cost per item: <10 is full price, 10-20 (inclusive) is 5% discount, and 21+ is 10% discount
#solution accepts a string input representing an item (dictionary key)
#solution accepts an integer input representing the number of items to be purchased
#solution outputs the item and total cost of purchase
item = input()
item_qty = int(input()) 

item_total = purchase[item] * item_qty
if item_qty < 10:
    print(f'{item} ${item_total:.2f}')
elif item_qty >= 10 and item_qty <= 20:
    discounted_rate = item_total * .05
    item_total = item_total - discounted_rate
    print(f'{item} ${item_total:.2f}')
elif item_qty >= 21:
    discounted_rate = item_total * .10
    item_total = item_total - discounted_rate
    print(f'{item} ${item_total:.2f}')
