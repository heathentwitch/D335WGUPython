The postfix of 3 is the last 3 characters of a string. Given a string input, output the last three characters of that string. Assume the string will always have at least three characters.

Ex: If the input is:

chicken

the output is:

Postfix: ken





''' Type your code here. '''
user_input = input()
post = int(len(user_input))
print(f'Postfix: {user_input[-3:]}') #-3 index with blank after : gets last 3 of string
