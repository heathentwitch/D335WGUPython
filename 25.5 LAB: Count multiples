Write a program that takes three integers as input: low, high, and x. The program then outputs the number of multiples of x between low and high inclusive.

Ex: If the input is:

1
10
2

the output is:

5

Hint: Use the % operator to determine if a number is a multiple of x. Use a for loop to test each number between low and high.





low = int(input())
high = int(input())
x = int(input())
count = 0
for n in range(low, high + 1):
    if n % x == 0:
        count += 1
            
        
print(count)
